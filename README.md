Started CS50 online with Harvard in March 2020 when covid hit.
Attempting to reboot some abilities I haven't been able to flex.
Hit the ground running! Within 5 months I had completed 6 assignments!
I was on my way, everything was flowing easily again.
</p>
<p>
Well I wasn't able to complete all assignments before the end of 2020.
It was urgent I return to work, our living conditions were not very good.
</p> 
<p>
Long story short.. I am doing my best to continue what I started.
In my free time, here and there, I've written many bash scripts.
They're designed to help me automate some administration tasks remotely.
